# Closing the Loop

Many scholars believe that learning analytics will not demonstrate real utility until it can "Close the Loop", use data to automate decision making. A common example of this system are email generators that send emails to students in response to an activity (or lack of activity). Several universities have had some success with this strategy such as George Washington University. There are an infinite number of these lopp closing activities that could be implemented and there is a lot of work to be done understanding when they are most useful.
